BERGO
=====

BER encoding and decoding library (ISO/IEC 8825-1, ITU-T X.690) in Go.

Introduction
------------

Basic Encoding Rule (BER) is generally associated to ASN.1 but can be, and
is, used elsewhere (like EMV standard for credit and debit card). This project
aims to support BER encoding and decoding as specified by X.690 (including the
many variation for real value).
